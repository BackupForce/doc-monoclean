# Identity Module Specification

## Overview
The Identity module centralizes authentication, authorization, and user profile
management for the platform. It provides a consistent interface for verifying
identities, managing credentials, and exposing role-based access control (RBAC)
policies to other services.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Account Lifecycle**: Create, update, deactivate, and archive user accounts.
- **Authentication**: Support password-based login, refresh tokens, and external
  identity providers via OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect.
- **Authorization**: Evaluate role and permission assignments to protect
  platform resources.
- **Audit & Compliance**: Record security-sensitive events for reporting and
  incident response.

## Domain Model
| Entity | Description | Key Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `User` | Represents a person or service principal with credentials. | `id`, `email`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| `Credential` | Stores password hash or external provider references. | `id`, `user_id`, `type`, `secret_hash`, `provider`, `expires_at` |
| `Role` | Groups permissions into reusable bundles. | `id`, `name`, `description` |
| `Permission` | Grants access to specific actions or resources. | `id`, `code`, `description` |
| `UserRole` | Joins users to roles. | `user_id`, `role_id`, `assigned_at` |
| `AuditEvent` | Captures authentication and authorization activities. | `id`, `user_id`, `event_type`, `metadata`, `occurred_at` |

## API Surface
- `POST /identity/users` – register a new user account.
- `GET /identity/users/{id}` – retrieve user profile details.
- `PATCH /identity/users/{id}` – update profile fields and status.
- `POST /identity/auth/login` – exchange credentials for access and refresh tokens.
- `POST /identity/auth/refresh` – refresh access tokens.
- `POST /identity/roles` – create a role with predefined permissions.
- `POST /identity/roles/{id}/assign` – assign a role to a user.
- `GET /identity/audit` – query audit events filtered by user, action, or time range.

## Events and Integrations
- Emits `UserRegistered`, `UserLocked`, `CredentialRotated`, and `RoleAssigned`
  domain events to the message bus.
- Consumes `OrganizationUpdated` events to synchronize display names and primary
  associations.
- Publishes audit events to the central logging pipeline for compliance review.

## Security Considerations
- Passwords stored using adaptive hashing (Argon2id or bcrypt with cost tuning).
- Refresh tokens rotated on every exchange and invalidated on logout.
- Multi-factor authentication hooks for email, SMS, or authenticator apps.
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints to mitigate brute force attempts.

## Operational Requirements
- Health checks exposing authentication latency and token issuance rates.
- Administrative tooling for support staff to reset passwords and unlock users.
- Configuration driven via environment variables and secrets management.
- Automated backups of user and audit data stores.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests covering credential validation and role resolution logic.
- Integration tests verifying token issuance and RBAC enforcement.
- End-to-end smoke tests ensuring identity flows across dependent services.
